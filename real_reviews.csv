4,B Complex in gel cap form,I bought this along with Vit C in gel cap form because a doctor explained on his website that he tests the blood of his patients regularly for the levels of various supplements he recommends and he claimed that pills seemed to result in extremely poor and uneven levels in the body. He also claimed gel caps were much better compared to pills in terms of a more even and reliable absorption into the blood stream.,B00012ND5G,B00012ND5G,AGDVFFLJWAQ3ULNNKF4LXID2RVSQ,11-12-2009 00:37,1,TRUE

Perhaps taking it with food would have helped, but the directions specifically say to take 'between' meals and based on the research I did, it has to be taken on an empty stomach to be absorbed.

I don't remember well but maybe I noticed my skin flush once when I woke up while sleeping but I forgot about that by going back to sleep. After that, I had no problems with flushing. But the important thing I think was that I was taking 500mg at night so my body had gotten a bit used to taking the niacin. So if you aren't already on the 500mg then I would not recommend starting on this dose because it's too high to start taking at the beginning. Start with 500mg & then when you're ready, step it up to this 1000mg dose.",B0002D34K8,B0002D34K8,AFJJ26UZXHIUEJZRJHNG2CJXYJZA,23-04-2013 05:25,0,TRUE
